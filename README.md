### cnn_digits_classifier.ipynb
- train a model to identfy a hand-written digit ot letter


### fizzbuzz.ipynb
- here we will do the fizz buzz problem
    - if the number is evenly divisiable by only 5
        - print out Buzz
    - if the number is evenly divisiable by only 3
        - print out Fizz
    - if the number is evenly divisiable by both (must be both, starts at 15)
        - print out FizzBuzz
    - else
        - print out the number

### odd_or_even_classifier.ipynb
- Goal:
        - Train a neural network classifier to classify if an integer is odd or even.
